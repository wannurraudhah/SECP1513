Completing this video assignment with a UTMD digital tour and virtual chat turned out to be a rewarding journey for our group. 
We carefully handled every detail and ensured that the video exceeded the expectations presented. 
From gathering information during the visit to conducting meaningful interviews, our findings included student benefits, 
impact on the course and the enthusiasm we generated amongst ourselves.
This assignment not only deepened our understanding of technology and information systems, but also honed our teamwork, 
creativity and presentation skills, contributing to a fulfilling learning experience.
