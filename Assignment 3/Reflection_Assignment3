To become a competent system developer, I must improve my capacity to handle projects involving 
avariety of individuals with varying skill sets and to work in groups throughout the course of the next four years.

which might be very helpful in this line of work. I must therefore maintain my connections with other professionals 
and other developers in order to share innovative ideas and to assist me obtain better opportunities in the field.
