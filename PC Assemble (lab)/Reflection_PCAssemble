Participating in the task of building the computer lab was a practical and enriching experience for me. 
Assembling the computer required a hands-on approach, combining theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. 
Working with my peers in a group improved my teamwork and communication skills as we took on challenges together and shared knowledge. 
Selecting and placing components, understanding compatibility, and troubleshooting potential problems provided a comprehensive overview of computer hardware. 
Thinking about this task makes me realize the importance of careful attention to detail in the assembly process. 
This hands-on experience not only strengthened my technical skills, but also instilled confidence in navigating the complexities of hardware components. 
Overall, computer assembly in the lab was a valuable exercise that combined theoretical concepts with practical skills and greatly contributed to my overall learning in computer hardware.
