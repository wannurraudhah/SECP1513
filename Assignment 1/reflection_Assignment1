I learned about the insights of the Malaysian Fintech startup Clarity Techworks SDN BHD through the webinar. 
It aids in my comprehension of each position's job scope. 
In addition, we discovered which abilities should be refined in order to be useful during education and an internship. 
We also received instructions on how to improve our organising abilities. 
Speakers offered guidance to inspire us and assist us in resolving any issues that could arise. 
Among the tips are to organise our work and assignments better for the benefit of our fellow teammates as well as for our personal reference. 
Additionally, it was recommended that we increase our familiarity with current technologies because we must be prepared to adjust to ongoing improvements in technology.
